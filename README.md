# Countries Factbook

Countries Factbook is a simple app that lets you bring up basic information about most countries of the world, as well as provides a simple currency converter.

## Installation

For the best experience, make sure to have the following versions installed before building and running the app:

* iOS version: _12.2_
* Xcode version: _10.1_
* Swift version: _4.2_

## Usage

On the first launch, you will need to provide a default currency to be able to use the currency converter feature. Once chosen, you will be redirected to a table of the countries available in the app.

Once a country is chosen, a new view will load with some simple information about the country. _Note that the view is scrollable, so make sure to scroll all the way in order to see all information on the page._

At the bottom of the view, there is the **currency converter** button. Click to use the currency converter feature.

The currency converter feature works like any online currency converter, enter the amount in the corresponding currency field, and the conversion will automatically take place.
