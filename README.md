# Countries Factbook

Countries Factbook is a simple app that lets you view basic information about most countries of the world, as well as provides a simple currency converter feature.

## Installation

For the best experience, make sure to have the following versions installed before building and running the app:

* iOS version: _13.0_
* Xcode version: _11.6_
* Swift version: _5.0_

## Usage

On the first launch, you will need to provide a default currency to be able to use the currency converter feature. Once selected, you will be redirected to the home page of the app.

Once a country is selected, a new view will load with some simple information about the country. _Note that the view is scrollable, so make sure to scroll all the way in order to see all information on the page._

There is also a **currency converter** feature. Click on the currency tab to use it.

The currency converter feature works like any online currency converter. Just enter the amount in the corresponding currency field, and the conversion will take place automatically.
